## Introduction:
This is an assignment of **SWEN504 Programming Lanagues.**   
The requirement of this assignment is to implement the same program in two different languages picking from C#, python, shell, haskell.   
I made a pair of book management application, with the functionality of book information displaying, book adding, deleting, searching and editing. Both applications are connected with a same MySQL database, which allow them to store book information for the long term and share data with each other.  
It's designed as a desktop application, and run on user's local machine.  
This is the C# version.
